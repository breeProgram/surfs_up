# surfs_up
## Introduction
Purpose of this analysis was to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. To find a solution I will query the temperatures for the month of June and December from 2010 to 2017, using the hawaii.sqlite file. Then Iâ€™ll save the results into a dataframe and use .describe() to get the statistics of the temperatures for those months.
## Results


- The difference between the mean temperatures for June (74.94 degrees) and December (71.04 degrees) is only 3 degrees.
- Lowest temperature recorded in December was 56 degrees, making too cold for surfing.
- On the other hand, the lowest 25 percentile for December temperatures is 69 degrees, warm enough for surfing and ice cream.
## Summary
Looking at these results, the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. While the temperature does drop in December, it remains relatively warm enough for people to go out for ice cream and surfing at the beach.
